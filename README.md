# Michelle Hapich's Portfolio

# Project 1: Cruelty-Free Company List
## [Cruelty Free Cosmetic Brands](https://github.com/mhapich/cruelty_free_products.git)

- This notebook will pull the latest list of cruelty-free brands from the website [Logical Harmony](https://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-brand-list/).
- Additional information about each brand includes whether it is vegan, if it is black-owned, and if its parent company is also cruelty-free
- I am currently working to include retailers that carry each brand, and a dashboard (using Dash) where users can search a brand to find this information

# Project 2: Data cleaning for district students' transcripts

## [Transcript data cleaning](https://github.com/mhapich/transcript_cleaning.git)

- This repo contains only the notebook file used to show the tasks done to find potential problems in data entry in our district's student information system (SIS).  
- There were problems with some data in the SIS that were causing discrepancies in the class ranks.  I assisted the technology supervisor and guidance department in finding these problems.  I exported this notebook as a simple to navigate pdf with notes on students whose information needed changed.
- I had to anonymize student identifiers to publish this notebook.  Because of this, the original csv file containing student names and id numbers is not included in this repo.
