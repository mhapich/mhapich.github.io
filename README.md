# Project 2: Data cleaning for district students' transcripts

## [Transcript data cleaning](https://github.com/mhapich/transcript_cleaning.git)

- This repo contains only the notebook file used to show the tasks done to find potential problems in data entry in our district's student information system (SIS).  
- There were problems with some data in the SIS that were causing discrepancies in the class ranks.  I assisted the technology supervisor and guidance department in finding these problems.  I exported this notebook as a simple to navigate pdf with notes on students whose information needed changed.
- I had to anonymize student identifiers to publish this notebook.  Because of this, the original csv file containing student names and id numbers is not included in this repo.
