# Michelle Hapich


ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github portfolio!

I'm a passionate and dedicated data professional with a background in education, transitioning from a career as a mathematics and computer science teacher to pursuing a career as a data scientist and data analyst. My journey into the world of data began when I earned a Professional Data Scientist Certificate from Datacamp, and I'm currently working on my final project to complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.  Stop back soon for the new project! (Teaser...local housing prices)

Throughout my teaching career, I had the privilege of guiding students in AP Calculus, Python, and Java, which cultivated my strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Now, I'm excited to apply my knowledge and expertise to tackle real-world data challenges, deriving valuable insights and making data-driven decisions.

My Github showcases a collection of projects, analyses, and visualizations that demonstrate my proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. With each endeavor, I strive to embrace the power of data in driving innovation and problem-solving across various domains.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the data science and data analytics field, where I can leverage my diverse background and data expertise to contribute meaningfully to projects and teams.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration or job opportunities. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together!

# Project 1: Taxi Fare Predictions in New York City
## Google Advanced Data Analytics Projects 
(this project is in progress and will be completed with notebook(s) and other files on GitHub by Oct. 25th)

**Overview**
The goal of this project was to ........... This project utilized yellow taxi trips taken in New York City during 2017. The final ..... model performed with 86% ....... determining ........ Based on the model, the duration, distance, and cost of the trip were most influential in determining a generous tipper (>20%) vs a non-generous one (<20%). 

**Business Understanding**
According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is important to understand what factors encourage riders to leave tips in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage. 

**Data Understanding**
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data came from 
NYC.gov
. The data consisted of approximately 408k unique trips and 18 features. The features included information on trip duration and destination, vendor used, toll information, and payment type. The bar chart below shows the breakdown of how many generous tippers (>20%) versus non-generous tippers that exist in the data set. 











# Project 2: Cruelty-Free Company List
## [Cruelty Free Cosmetic Brands](https://github.com/mhapich/cruelty_free_products.git)

- I created a dataset which contains a list of cruelty-free brands from the website [Logical Harmony](https://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-brand-list/).
- Additional information about each brand includes whether its product line is vegan, if it is black-owned, and if its parent company is also cruelty-free
- Other information in the csv includes whether or not the brand is sold at one of five top retailers
- After scraping the products from multiple pages on the [Logical Harmony](https://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-brand-list/) website, I cleaned the data and put it into a dataset that I uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhapich/crueltyfree-brands)
- This dataset currently has a 14% download per view ratio, having been viewed over 1100 times and downloaded more than 150 times. It has been downloaded at least once every day since being published.

### Please see my interactive Tableau dashboard: ###
Here, you can search for a brand to find out more about it, or you can filter the lists to only see things like black-owned brands, brands that have parent companies that do utilize animal testing on other products, or brands that are both vegan and have a good parent company.

# Project 3: Python to Tableau - Stock Market Prices
## [Stock Market Data and Dashboard](https://github.com/mhapich/nasdaq.git)
- In this repo you can see my Jupyter notebook, and also the many files that were containing the most recent stock prices and information up to that date.
- Using Pandas, I created several of the features I would later be using in Tableau.
- I will soon be updating this project. The update will contain different stocks - stocks I own, plus vegan stocks.
- The stock prices will be the most recent from Yahoo Finance.
- Here is a screenshot of my [Tableau interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/StockMarketInteractiveDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) where you can change the dates and the company on which to focus.
- I will also be creating and linking a new, more original Tableau dashboard.
