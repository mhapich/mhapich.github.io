# Project 1: Data cleaning for district students' transcripts

## [Transcript data cleaning](https://github.com/mhapich/transcript_cleaning.git)

- This repo contains only the notebook file used to show the tasks done to find potential problems in data entry in our district's student information system (SIS).  
- These entries in the SIS may have been causing discrepancies in the class ranks.  As a result, I assisted the technology supervisor and guidance department in finding and fixing problems.
- I had to anonymize student identifiers to publish this notebook.  Because of this, the original csv file containing student names and id numbers is not included in this repo.
